### Towers of Hanoi

# The Towers of Hanoi is a game where there are 3 pillars and, on one pillar, there is a stack of 64
# disks of different sizes, with the largest disk at the bottom and the smallest disk at the top.
# The goal of the game is to move the disk stack to another pillar following these rules:

# * Movement: can only move one disk at a time
# * Arrangement: a larger disk can never cover up a small disk

# **Strategy for two disks**:

# * Move the smaller top disk to a spare pillar
# * Move the larger bottom disk to another spare pillar
# * Move the smaller disk to the other spare pillar (on top of the larger disk)

# **Strategy abstracted**:

# * There is a stack of n disks
# * Move a stack of size n-1 to a spare pillar
# * Move a single disk n (the one that was at the bottom of the stack) to another spare pillar
# * Move the stack of size n-1 to the other spare pillar (on top of disk n)

# **Strategy abstracted further**:

# * Three locations denominated as such:
    # - `fr`: the pillar *from* where the stack is moved
    # - `to`: the pillar *to* where the stack is moved
    # - `spare`: the pillar that is empty, *spare*

# * The "movements" are made with words, e.g. "move from a to spare", "move from a to b", "move from
#   spare to b"
    # - this is done with a print statement `print( 'move from ' + str(fr) + ' to ' + str(to) )`
    # - this print statement runs through a function which "loads the coordinates" `fr` and `to`
    # - this function is called `printMove`
    
# * The movements are as follows:
    # -  Move stack of size `n-1` from the `fr` pillar to the `spare` pillar 
    # -  Move the base case `1` (a single disk) to another pillar 
    # -  Move stack of size `n-1` from the spare to the `to` pillar (on top of the single disk) 

# * The movements are elicited by the `Towers` function, which:
    # - organizes the movements
    # - calls the `printMove` function that makes the movements

# * The three necessary movements are organized through these (recursive) calls:
    # - `Towers( n-1, fr, spare, to )`
    # - `Towers( 1, fr, to, spare )`
    # - `Towers( n-1, spare, to, fr )`

# tester .........................................
Towers(4, "a", "b", "spare pillar") # each pillar has been named a, b, and c

# the calls above might be better understood if written as below

#       Towers( n = n-1, fr = fr,    to = spare, spare = to )
#       Towers( n = 1,   fr = fr,    to = to,    spare = spare )
#       Towers( n = n-1, fr = spare, to = to,    spare = fr )

# i.e. this makes it more clear how the PASSED arguments move around for each call, but the expected
# arguments stay the same as when they were defined


# The sample call `Towers(4, "a", "b", "spare pillar")` means:

# 1. When entering the function, following the function definition `Towers( n, fr, to, spare )`:
#  `n = 4`, `fr = "a"`, `to = "b"`, and `spare = "spare pillar"`.

# 2. The values above go in the first type of call `Towers( n-1, fr, spare, to )`. This call means
# that the values passed to the towers function are rearranged as such:

#     * the `n` argument is passed the value n-1: 3
#     * the `fr` argument is passed the original value of `fr`: "a"
#     * the `to` argument is passed the original value of `spare`: "spare pillar"
#     * the `spare` argument is passed the original value of `to`: "b"

# 3. The second type of call `Towers( 1, fr, to, spare )` means that:

#     * the `n` argument is passed the value `1`, which will trigger the `if` clause
#     * the other arguments are passed the original values

# 4. The third type of call `Towers( n-1, spare, to, fr )` means that: 

#     * the `n` argument is passed the value n-1: 3
#     * the `fr` argument is passed the original value of `spare`: "spare pillar"
#     * the `to` argument is passed the original value of `to`: "b"
#     * the `spare` argument is passed the original value of `fr`: "a"

# 5. maybe it would have been better form to write as such:

Towers( n = n-1, fr = fr,    to = spare, spare = to )
Towers( n = 1,   fr = fr,    to = to,    spare = spare )
Towers( n = n-1, fr = spare, to = to,    spare = fr )

### gcdIter and gcdRecur


# unit 2, lesson 4, exercise which follows L4_S8--1_hanoi.md

# 21. Exercise: gcd iter
# an iterative function to find the greatest common divisor

def gcdIter(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers
    
    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    testValue = min(a, b)

    # Keep looping until testValue divides both a & b evenly
    while a % testValue != 0 or b % testValue != 0:
        testValue -= 1

    return testValue


# unit 2, lesson 4, exercise which follows L4_S8--1_hanoi.md

# 22. Exercise: gcd recur
# a recursive function to find the greatest common divisor

def gcdRecur(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers
    
    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    # Base case is when b = 0
    if b == 0:
        return a

    # Recursive case
    return gcdRecur(b, a % b)


# * The order mattersâ€”e.g. `gcdRecur(0,1)` is not the same as `gcdRecur(1,0)`.

#     - But you don't need to do separate code to account for this. Just test if `b == 0`.

#     - If it's not (and `a == 0` as in the case `gcdRecur(0,1)`), the function will enter the
#       recursive step and compute `0 % 1 = 0` and put that in the `b` position. Then in the next
#       iteration, the `if` will trigger and return `a` (which was 0).

#     - note that the test is if `b == 0` because you don't want to try to calculate `a%0`, as it is
#       undefined (division by 0)

# (commented and explained)

# recursion on non-numerics
# check if a string of characters is a palindrome

# The isPalindrome function contains (i) the toChars function and (ii) the isPal function.

# (i) The toChars function changes uppercase to lowercase and strips out all the spaces and
# punctuation, returns "ans". In the code below, there seems to be no point to it as "ans" is not
# used again (maybe ans should have been passed to isPal).

# (ii) The isPal function checks if s is a palindrome 

# * first it checks if the string s is of length 1 or less (one letter or blank); if it is, it is a
#   palindrome and returns True. This is the line that exits isPal and thus ends the recursion.

# * if s is longer than one letter, it checks if the first s[0] and last element s[-1] are the same
#   s[0] == s[-1] and returns a True/False
#   - if it's True, the isPal function is called again (this is the recursion) with the argument 
#     s[1:-1] i.e. a slice of the string s that starts at the second character and ends at the -1
#     character In other words, the new string passed is a shorter string than the one before with 
#     the first and second letters of the one before removed.

def isPalindrome(s):
    
    def toChars(s): # (i) ..........
        s = s.lower()

                ans = ans + c
        return ans # Why is this even here? (It's not used and not returned.)

    def isPal(s): # (ii) ..........
