# my_python_notes
Introductory CSCI notes for the Python programming language

Most of the material in this repository is taken from the MITx course 
**Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (6.00.1x)**

The basis of this material is *copied and pasted* from class slides and transcripts, but I have
arranged, re-arranged, explained, re-explained, commented, and changed comments to make it easier
to understand. In other words: the contents of this file are either *very different* to the
original class material or *essentially the same and don't provide anything new*, depending on how
you want to look at it. No claims are made and no guarantees are given; these are simply my
personal notes and they are arranged and edited in a way that is convenient for me.

If you want the complete course material this is not a good place to look. By a standard of "having
all the notes to help me can pass the class" this repo would be disorganized, incomplete in some
ways, and too expansive in other ways.

Note: the course is organized in `units` that contain `lessons` that contain videos and exercises. I
refer to the videos as "`sessions`" (as in class sessions) and give them their own numbering.
(The website numbers everything sequentially, but that doesn't make clear that the exercises are
related to the video.)
